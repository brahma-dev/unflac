# unflac

A command line tool for frame accurate FLAC image + cue sheet splitting.

WIP.

This project is started mostly out of frustration over supporting
[split2flac](https://github.com/ftrvxmtrx/split2flac) with all the
external dependencies and their quirks.

## Dependencies

 * metaflac
 * ffmpeg

Yeah, that's it.
